## Combined Cycle Power Plant Dataset

This dataset comprises 9568 data points gathered from a Combined Cycle Power Plant spanning six years (2006-2011). During this period, the power plant operated at full load. The dataset includes hourly average readings of various ambient variables such as Temperature (T), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH), and Exhaust Vacuum (V). These variables are instrumental in predicting the net hourly electrical energy output (EP) of the plant.

# Features:
Temperature (T): Ranges from 1.81°C to 37.11°C.
Ambient Pressure (AP): Ranges from 992.89 to 1033.30 millibar.
Relative Humidity (RH): Ranges from 25.56% to 100.16%.
Exhaust Vacuum (V): Ranges from 25.36 to 81.56 cm Hg.
Net Hourly Electrical Energy Output (EP): Ranges from 420.26 to 495.76 MW.
These hourly averages are derived from sensor data collected around the plant, with readings recorded every second.

# Combined Cycle Power Plant (CCPP):
A CCPP is a power generation facility consisting of gas turbines (GT), steam turbines (ST), and heat recovery steam generators. In a CCPP, electricity is produced by gas and steam turbines operating in tandem within a single cycle. The energy generated is transferred between turbines. While vacuum levels primarily impact the performance of the steam turbine, the other three ambient variables notably affect GT performance.
